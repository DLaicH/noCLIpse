So, you're creating an Android project, but you just hate Eclipse. "It's so finicky and buggy and bloated and awful," you complain. "Well then," I reply, "just use the command line tools." "But typing is haaard," you whine.

Well a solution is now in the making. An intrepid team of barely-employed twenty somethings has come together to create an Android project manager that requires neither Eclipse nor a CLI.

Depends on
----------

* Python 2.4+
* wxPython
* py-androidbuild (referenced in the externals folder)
    * can be installed in linux using `./install_py-androidbuild_linux`
